Q1:
You would use id's when you want to specify a style for an unique element on the page,
or when you want to get a specific element on the page programmatically 
(using Element.getElementById(id)). For example, if you have an id on a section and a button
to toggle the visibility of that section, you would get the element by it's id using 
getElementById and change it's visibility attribute. 

Classes are meant for reuse. If you have a css class for a section header, you only want to write the 
css for it once, and then reuse it on all the section headers on your page. Here, classes 
are the way to go. 



Q2: 
R - Red
G - Green
B - Blue
A - Alpha

You can create all colors that can be made from the combinations of red, green, and blue, and 
you can use the alpha channel to make it transparent. 


Q3: 
"article p" or "article > p"
