Q1: 
position: absolute 
The element with this property will adjust its position with respect to its parent. 
It is removed from the flow, and you can position it whereever you like using the
top, bottom, left, and right properties. 

position: fixed 
This will position the element relative to the viewport, so that it stays in 
the same place when you scroll. You can position it the same way you would 
position an element with absolute position. 

Q2: 
You would use the `:nth-child` selector together with the selector of the parent element,
like so: 
   
.container :nth-child(3) {
    ...
}

Q3: 
If you visit a site using a device with a 320 x 568 resolution 
this media query will not take effect, 
and the styles within it will not affect the elements on the page.
This is because the media query is only active when the screen with is 
between 768px and 1024px.
